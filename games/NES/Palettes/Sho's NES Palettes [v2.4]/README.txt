Thank you for downloading this palette pack!  Name's Sho, nice to meet ya.   This palette pack was put together as a way of expanding the available palette set for the various NES solutions that have come to prominence over the last few years -- the Analogue Nt Mini & Mini Noir, as well as for the MiSTer, Mesen, Raspberry Pi, and various other emulators and NES solutions which can accept the .pal file format.

Many of these palettes have been sourced across the Internet by yours truly, as well as a number of custom palettes either created by myself, or recreated from color information using Mesen.  All of these palettes have been tested to work with Mesen, Nt Mini, Mini Noir & MiSTer to work without issues.  So without further ado...
